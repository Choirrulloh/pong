In this project I have worked on Android application testing using:

  [1] Appium.
  [2] Ruby.
  [3] RSpec.

The application under test is 'Yelp'. I have used both Selenium webdriver and Appium's in built functions to automate the app.

The basic features considered for testing is:

[1] Install the app from Play Store.
[2] Test for login/sign up with different data (CSV file).
[3] Basic search functionality of Yelp.
[4] Scroll and search.
